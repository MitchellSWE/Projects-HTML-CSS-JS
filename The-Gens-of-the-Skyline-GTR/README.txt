This project is based of UDEMY 50 Projects in 50 Days HTML, CSS & JS. I added my own twist of using the Generations of the Skyline GT-R's to see how the difference from each Generation. In this project I learned more about JS (Arrow function and Event Listener) and for CSS (How to style and modify classes). This project is responsive so when the device screen reaches below 480 width, the last two images will be removed.
