This project is a Progression Tracker so when the user clicks the "Next" button, a line would progress to the next step till it reaches the end and vice versa. 
In this project I learned more about styling and the logic that goes into a progress tracker.

This project is based of UDEMY 50 Projects in 50 Days HTML, CSS & JS by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop. All rights goes to them.
